abstract: Accommodation in intimate relationships refers to the tendency to react constructively instead of retaliating when a partner behaves in a potentially destructive way. We tested the effect of implicit accommodation on romantic relationship persistence compared with the effects of explicit measures. We measured implicit accommodation with the affective valence of facial expression in response to the partnerâ€™s angry facial expression using automated facial coding software. Explicit accommodation and relationship satisfaction were measured with self-reported scales. Using Bayesian analyses, we revealed that the effect of implicit accommodation credibly predicted relationship persistence above and beyond the effect of explicit measures. In conclusion, implicit accommodation may be a potent predictor of romantic relationship persistence, which provides additional information to explicit measures.
