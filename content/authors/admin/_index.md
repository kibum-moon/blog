I am a Data Psychologist. My research tries to find the best ways to incorporate data science techniques into psychological research. I am interested in developing data-driven assessment tools to elucidate the subtle aspects of personality, emotion, and quality of relationship.

I am currently working as a data scientist at the Office of Digital Information of Korea University, participating in a series of AI projects. The present project focuses on building an automatic assessment model to monitor students’ psychological adaptation.

Prior to this position, I was a clinical researcher at the students counseling center of Korea University, conducting research on developing and validating psychological measurements, and developing an automatized psychological reporting system from the scratch.
