I am a data psychologist whose goal is to become a helpful do-gooder by doing good. Most of the things that fascinate me usually exist between people and people. 

I hone my expertise in positive emotions, close relationships, and their associations with mental and physical well-being, so that my unstoppable curiosity about others can be beneficial to make people live happier and healthier lives. 

During my 5 years of dedication as a group leader and project organizer of the "Mental Fitness Program", a positive psychology-based intervention, I have been delighted with the meaningful changes that I have made in other's lives. 

Recently, with 2 years of experience as a data scientist, I have been enthralled by discovering many untouched possibilities of making psychology more efficient and more accessible, even for those who have been marginalized with traditional psychological practices, by leveraging big data and ML/DL algorithms.
