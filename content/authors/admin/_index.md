I am a Data Psychologist.

I am interested in positive emotions, social relationships, and their associations with happier and healthier lives of people.  

My research aims to make psychological research and interventions more efficient and accessible to broader populations, especially for those who have been marginalized with traditional methods. 

To this end, I hope to develop automated measuring methods by leveraging data science, to discover many untouched possibilities in the field that I love - Psychology.
