title: 'Development and Application of an AI-Powered Adaptive Course Recommender System in Higher Education: An Example from K University'

abstract: This paper outlines the development process of an AI-based elective course recommendation system on the basis of rapid prototype methodology (RP), from algorithm modeling to development of a user interface and follow-up survey. The algorithms used to produce recommendations employed either user-based collaborative filtering or a class history-based statistical model, incorporating students â€™ course ratings and course enrollment history data. The system was implemented on the campus portal website in July 2020, and a satisfaction survey was conducted. Our results, based on 782 responses, demonstrated that the statistical-based model had significantly higher satisfaction than the collaborative filtering model. However, a follow-up survey based on course wish list and course registration data found that Recall@21 for the collaborative filtering model was about 37% and 43%, respectively, compared with 18% and 14%, respectively, for the statistical-based model. Thus, we found a difference between satisfaction with the recommended list and actual course behavior. In their responses, students regarded their academic interests as the top priority when choosing elective courses, and noted that keywords, capable of fully describing the lectures, were vital information due to ambiguous course titles. This study is expected to contribute to the further development and real application of AI-based recommendation systems in Korean higher education institutions.
