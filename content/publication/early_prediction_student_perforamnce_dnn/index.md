abstract: Log data accumulated in the Learning Management System (LMS) provide high-quality information for the learning process of students. Until now, various studies have been conducted to predict studentsâ€™ academic achievement using LMS log data. However, previous studies were based on relatively small sample sizes of students and courses, limiting the possibility of generalization. This study developed and validated a deep neural network model for the early prediction of academic achievement of college students using massive LMS log data. To this end, we used 78,466,385 cases of LMS log data and 165,846 cases of grade data. The proposed model predicted the excellent-grade students with a high level of accuracy from the beginning of the semester. Meanwhile, the prediction accuracy for the moderate and underachieving groups was relatively low, but the accuracy improved as the time points of the prediction were delayed. This study is meaningful in that we developed an early prediction model based on a deep neural network with sufficient accuracy for practical utilization by only using LMS log data.
