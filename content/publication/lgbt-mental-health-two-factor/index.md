abstract: In this study, we aimed to verify the validity of the mental health two-factor structure for a group of sexual minority(LGB) in South Korea. To this end, 464 people who were recruited from the Queer portal site completed K-MHC-SF (Korean Mental Health Continuum-Short Form), K-MDI (Korean Mental Disorder Inventory), and LGBIS (The Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Scale). To compare model fit, we then conducted a Confirmatory Factor Analysis(CFA) of the study and competition models. Based on this, We investigated one-way ANOVA and Post-hoc analysis whether mental health groups differ in psychosocial adaptations in terms of sexual minority identity depending on Keyes(2002)â€™s classification of mental health groups. CFA revealed that in comparison to the one-factor model and independent two-factor model, the correlated two-factor model was best fit. One-way ANOVA revealed significant differences in various LGB Identity related variables according to mental health groups. Post-hoc analysis indicated the complete mental health group showed the best results regarding psychosocial adaptation, and the pure mental illness groups had a better level of psychosocial adaptation than the pure languishing group. Lastly, the importance of positive mental health research and intervention for sexual minority populations was discussed.
